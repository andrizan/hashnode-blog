## Using Rsync to Sync Local System

his puts folder A into folder B:

```bash
rsync -avu --delete "/home/user/A" "/home/user/B"
```

If you want the **contents of folders A and B** to be the same, put `/home/user/A/` (with the slash) as the source. This takes not the folder A but all of its content and puts it into folder B. Like this:

```bash
rsync -avu --delete "/home/user/A/" "/home/user/B"
```

* `-a` Do the sync preserving all filesystem attributes
    
* `-v` run verbosely
    
* `-u` only copy files with a newer modification time (or size difference if the times are equal)
    
* `--delete` delete the files in target folder that do not exist in the source

## Using Rsync to Sync with a Remote System

To use `rsync` to sync with a remote system, you only need SSH access configured between your local and remote machines, as well as `rsync` installed on both systems. Once you have SSH access verified between the two machines, you can sync the `dir1` folder from the previous section to a remote machine by using the following syntax. Please note in this case, that you want to transfer the actual directory, so you’ll omit the trailing slash:

```bash
rsync -a ~/dir1 username@remote_host:destination_directory
#OR
rsync -a -e 'ssh -p 2320' ~/dir1 username@remote_host:destination_directory
```

This process is called a *push* operation because it “pushes” a directory from the local system to a remote system. The opposite operation is *pull*, and is used to sync a remote directory to the local system. If the `dir1` directory were on the remote system instead of your local system, the syntax would be the following:

```bash
rsync -a username@remote_host:/home/username/dir1 place_to_sync_on_local_machine
```

Like `cp` and similar tools, the source is always the first argument, and the destination is always the second.
