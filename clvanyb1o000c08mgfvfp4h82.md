these 10 colors are mandatory for creating a ColorSheme for Flutter ThemData.Values for each color are optional.

`primary` : This is the most used color in the application

`onPrimary` : This color is used to color the elements on top of the primary color such as text, icons, etc.

`secondary` : This defines a secondary color, often used for less prominent elements like filter chips, toggle buttons, or background elements that need to stand out from the primary color but not overpower it.

`onSecondary` : This color is used to color the elements on top of the secondary color.

`error` : This is the color used for error messages or alerts, like a flashing red light to indicate a problem.

`onError` : This is the text color that goes well on the `error` color, like white text on a red sign for easy reading.

`background` : The primary background color for your entire application. Think of this as the canvas upon which all other UI elements are placed.

`onBackground` : This color is used to color the elements on top of the background color.

`surface` : Used as the base color for elevated UI elements like cards, sheets, dialogs, etc.

`onSurface` : use to color the elements on top of the surface color.
